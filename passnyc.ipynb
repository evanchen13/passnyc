    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Each year, thousands of eighth and ninth grade students in New York City take the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT) in hopes of getting into one of the city's eight specialized high schools. These institutions are considered to be prestigious and can have potentially tremendous impacts on students' lives, but the only way to gain admission is to take the SHSAT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, the demographics at the specialized high schools have become increasingly homogeneous, so the mission of PASSNYC is to identify schools with underrepresented demographics and, through consultation and outreach, increase the amount of students from these schools that take the SHSAT. Ultimately, if more diverse students take the exam, then more of them will also be admitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "As PASSNYC states in its competition on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/passnyc/data-science-for-good), the organization would like more assistance in identifying schools where its services would be most useful. Therefore, I will perform some wrangling and exploration on data provided by both PASSNYC and other public sources, as well as construct a model to learn more about what features are important in identifying schools with low participation in the SHSAT. I will also evaluate how useful this model is by looking at the actual vs. predicted values and the distribution of residuals. This will allow me to see how well the model actually fits the existing data and, consequently, how much I can trust the feature importance provided by the model.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned at the beginning, the goal of this project was to determine what variables have the most influential role in predicting what percentage of a school's students will sit for the SHSAT. I determined that exam success in the sixth to eighth grades, average subject proficiency, and the percentage of Black and Hispanic students are strong factors that determine how many students will take the SHSAT at a given school.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest challenges was finding adequate data for this process, as PASSNYC only provided SHSAT registration data for District 5. I ended up having to wrangle three datasets and combine them in order to create the target variable that I was looking for. Even then, I had fewer than 100 schools to work with in the final dataset. My original plan was actually to create a predictive model that would allow PASSNYC to predict what percentage of students would sit for the SHSAT at a given school. However, with such little data, it made more sense to use all the data to see feature importances, rather than splitting into even smaller training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this challenge, one method to improve the project would be to increase the amount of data that I can use when modeling. There could be several ways to tackle this. Perhaps there is more data on SHSAT registration on the Internet, and I could use web scraping techniques to get this data. I could also think of other ways to construct my target variable, or even change the target variable to measure a difference metric. By doing so, I could end up with more data, which would then allow me to split it up into training and test sets and create a predictive model for PASSNYC going forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "If finding more data is too difficult, however, I could improve the project by making the model more interpretable. There are a couple of ways to do this. First, I could use the final model to make predictions for the target variable, and then fit a decision tree to the predictions to somewhat mimic the logic of the model. The decision tree could then be plotted in order to visualize the thought process. Another way would be to use local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). With LIME, I would be able to see what variables are the top contributors to the prediction for a single instance. A downside, though, is that a single instance does not necessarily represent the entire data, so the results may not be applicable to other instances.\n",
